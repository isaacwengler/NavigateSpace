Navigate Space

Why?
We wanted to make a 3d view of the solar system to allow children to learn more about space in a fun 3d interactive world. We have a passion for space and we want to allow children to learn more about our solar system and share the same love for the milky way that our team has.

Description
This project incoporates three.js to render a 3d view of our solar system. You are able to visit each planet and get a first person view of what it would be like to land on the planet. You also get random information about the planet that is dynamically rendered when you visit a specific planet.

What we learned
We learned how to incorporate 3js into vanilla javascript and rendered 3d images. We also had to perform mathematical calculations to get the right orbits of each planet.
